# CodeNest

**CodeNest** is my personal hub for all coding configurations, snippets, and shortcuts. It centralizes tools and settings that improve productivity and streamline development across different projects and environments.

## Contents

| File / Folder | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `keybindings.json` | Custom VS Code keybindings. |
| `snippets/` | C++ snippets and other language-specific code snippets. |
| `espanso/` | Espanso shortcut files for text expansion. |
| `settings.json` | VS Code workspace/user settings. |

## Usage

1. Copy or symlink the relevant files to your local development environment:
   - VS Code: Place `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` in the appropriate VS Code configuration folder.
   - Espanso: Place files in your Espanso configuration directory.
   - Snippets: Use or import as needed in your projects.
2. Update files as your workflow evolves to keep CodeNest current.

## Contribution

This is primarily a personal folder, but feel free to fork or adapt the setup for your own use. Contributions are welcome if you have improvements for snippets, shortcuts, or configurations.
